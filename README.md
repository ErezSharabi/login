# login
Simple login screen using php and mysql
1) Create mysql DB for your users that include (at least) these parameters:'mail' 'user_name' and 'password'
2) update the mysql connection parameters in the index.php file
3) Load the php file to the VM and enjoy

***Comment:  need to move it to implement the mysql query with PDO in order to avoid mysql injection.
